# TouchVisual

A **node-based, ]visual processing engine** built in Python using **OpenCV, NumPy, and PyQt**, inspired by **TouchDesigner**.

This project demonstrates how generative visuals, feedback systems, motion analysis, and creative-coding workflows can be implemented **programmatically without TouchDesigner**.

## Features

- **Video Input**
  - Load video files via desktop UI
  - Frame-by-frame real-time processing

- **Node-Based Architecture**
  - Modular visual nodes
  - Sequential processing pipeline
  - Each effect is isolated, reusable, and stateful

- **Visual Effects (Nodes)**
  - Feedback / Motion Echo
  - Glow / Bloom
  - RGB Split / Glitch
  - Extensible architecture for motion detection, noise, tracking, audio reactivity

- **Desktop GUI**
  - Built using PyQt
  - Live preview window
  - Real-time parameter control
  - Start / Stop playback

- **Real-Time Rendering**
  - Preserves original resolution
  - Designed for generative visuals and experimentation
